# ielts-speaking-questions-creator-v1

📝 This is the initial draft of the project.

🔍 I will be sourcing the questions from the following link: https://www.bestmytest.com/ielts/speaking

💥 The concept is to randomly select a topic and a list of questions corresponding to the question set number of that topic for each part of the IELTS speaking test.

🚀 Currently, I am displaying only the topic number. I will soon update the feature to show both the topic names and questions.
